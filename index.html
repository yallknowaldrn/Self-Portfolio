    <h4>Background on Information Technology</h4>
    <p>When I started college, I was really fascinated by computers. I thought they were amazing machines with endless possibilities! So, I decided to study Information Technology (IT), which is all about understanding and working with computers.
          In college, I learned about all the parts of a computer â€“ like the hardware (the physical stuff you can touch), the software (the programs that make the computer work), and how they all connect together in networks. I also became really interested in keeping computer systems safe from hackers and other bad stuff, which is called cybersecurity.
          As I keep going with my studies, I'm excited to learn even more and use what I know to help solve problems and make cool things with technology!</p>
